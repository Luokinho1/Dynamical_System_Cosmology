Third-year summer project exploring dynamical systems applied to the time evolution of scalar field cosmological models. Developed phase portraits from autonomous equations to illustrate the evolution of scalar field energy densities, demonstrating that sufficiently flat potentials can lead to cosmic acceleration.
